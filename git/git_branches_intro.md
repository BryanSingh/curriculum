# Git Branches Introduction
This lesson is focused on one of the key features of Git: branches. Branches can be useful for testing new ideas, compartmentalizing projects, and allowing multiple developers to contribute to the same project simultaneously. 

For example, you might decide that your web app needs GitHub authentication while another developer is building a profile page for your users. By using Git branches you will both be able to write new code without causing problems for one another.
